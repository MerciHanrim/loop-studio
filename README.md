# Loop Studio

Loop Studio is a browser-based **visual systems editor and simulator** —
draw a Machinations-style diagram of pools, sources, drains, gates, and
converters, then run a deterministic, seeded simulation to see how the
system behaves over time. Built primarily for **game economies**, the same
step-based model generalises to inventory/supply chains, service queues,
cash flows, and other resource-flow systems; it's an independent, client-only
implementation — nothing is uploaded, the whole app runs in your browser, and
a graph is a plain JSON file you own. Work is kept in your browser profile
only when you say it is your own browser; on a shared computer a temporary
session neither reads nor saves stored work, author information or settings
([docs/storage-sessions.md](docs/storage-sessions.md)).

**Run it now: <https://cozy-loop-studio.pages.dev>** — available in
[18 languages](#languages), with five bundled Templates ranging from a small
production flow to a large game economy and a three-zone probability/pity
comparison.

## Key features

- **Visual diagram editor** — pools, sources, drains, gates, and converters;
  resources move between them on a deterministic, discrete-step simulation;
  select a region of nodes from the rail and move them together, or place nodes
  in a named frame that moves with its contents
- **Seeded RNG + Monte Carlo** — probabilistic gates and flows, and
  many-run outcome distributions with percentile bands
- **A small model language** — `parameter` / `register` nodes with a safe
  arithmetic expression grammar, guided `@`-autocomplete authoring, and a
  name-and-value read-back
- **Executable state connections** — `trigger` (+ delay), `activator`, and
  `label` Pool modifiers, with in-canvas pulse / tint / flash feedback
- **Simulation playback** — resources visibly depart, travel the real edge
  path, and arrive before values update, in dependency order
- **Data import & collaboration** — bring the numbers you already keep in a
  spreadsheet (CSV/TSV paste or upload) in as adjustable Parameters, with a
  manual refresh and a three-way diff — see [`docs/import-guide.md`](docs/import-guide.md);
  plus file-based project revisions & proposals for asynchronous
  collaboration — no accounts, no server
- **Runs anywhere** — an installable offline PWA, a portable single-file
  build, shareable links (optionally protected with a password), and a UI translated into
  [18 languages](#languages)

## Languages

<!-- LOCALES:BEGIN — the codes in this table are checked against the locale
     registry by `src/i18n/readmeLocales.test.ts`. Adding or removing a shipped
     language must update this table in the same change. -->

The UI ships in 18 languages, listed here the way the in-app picker orders
them. Pick one under **Settings → Language**; the first visit follows your
browser's language, and the choice is remembered on that device.

| Code | Language | In its own words |
|---|---|---|
| `ar` | Arabic | العربية |
| `zh-Hans` | Chinese (Simplified) | 简体中文 |
| `zh-Hant` | Chinese (Traditional) | 繁體中文 |
| `nl` | Dutch | Nederlands |
| `en` | English | English |
| `fr` | French | Français |
| `de` | German | Deutsch |
| `it` | Italian | Italiano |
| `ja` | Japanese | 日本語 |
| `ko` | Korean | 한국어 |
| `pt-BR` | Portuguese (Brazil) | Português (Brasil) |
| `pt-PT` | Portuguese (Portugal) | Português (Portugal) |
| `ru` | Russian | Русский |
| `es-419` | Spanish (Latin America) | Español (Latinoamérica) |
| `es-ES` | Spanish (Spain) | Español (España) |
| `th` | Thai | ไทย |
| `tr` | Turkish | Türkçe |
| `vi` | Vietnamese | Tiếng Việt |

<!-- LOCALES:END -->

Regional pairs are separate locales, not one catalog with a flag: a browser
asking for `pt-PT` gets European Portuguese, while `pt`, `pt-BR` and the
African Portuguese tags get Brazilian — and the same split holds for the two
Spanish and the two Chinese catalogs. See
[`docs/localization.md`](docs/localization.md) for the resolution order and
the per-locale notes.

## Representative use cases

The *3-zone gacha banner comparison* Template runs three pity/pickup rule
sets — **General/Free**, **Premium Standard** (hard-pity ceiling), and
**Premium Pickup** (hard-pity + a pickup guarantee) — side by side, 200 pulls
per zone under identical run settings. Once a run completes, its hit and
pickup rates are easy to compare; run Monte Carlo analysis to inspect the
distribution across many runs.

![The gacha Template after a completed 200-pull-per-zone run: five comparison cards reading real hit-rate/pickup-rate percentages, a Timeline with per-zone SSR/pickup curves, and a Register's expression read-back open in the right column](docs/assets/gacha-overview.png)

*Premium Pickup, framed on its own* — the hard-pity counter forces the next
roll's SSR once it hits the ceiling; whether that (or any ordinary) SSR lands
as pickup or standard depends on the `Pickup owed` guarantee flag, which a
miss sets and the next SSR consumes.

## Develop locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev             # http://localhost:5173
npm run build            # -> dist/            static SPA, deploy anywhere
npm run build:portable   # -> dist-portable/   single self-contained index.html (file://)
npm run lint
npm test                 # vitest (engine + store unit tests)
npm run e2e              # Playwright browser end-to-end
```

Requires **Node 22+** (`.nvmrc` pins `22`). React + TypeScript + Vite,
[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) for the canvas, Zustand for state; the
simulation engine is a dependency-free, unit-tested TypeScript module kept
separate from the UI. Deployed on Cloudflare Pages; CI on GitHub Actions.

Behaviour is frozen in versioned spec documents; a behavioural change means a
new spec id, never an edit to a frozen one.

## Latest — v0.25.0

Diagrams line up on a grid, and connections between nodes in a row stay straight in every
language.

- **A layout grid**: a new node lands on the canvas grid, and a drag or an arrow key moves
  nodes and frames along it; hold Alt to drag freely, and Ctrl (⌘ on a Mac), no longer Alt,
  to move a frame without its contents
- **Ports on one row**: a node's side connection points sit 28 px below its top whatever its
  height, so a node with a long name grows downward and its connections do not move
- **Older diagrams are lined up once**: a diagram saved by an earlier version is placed on the
  grid when it opens, as part of opening it (a project revision keeps its recorded layout);
  Tidy to grid in the canvas controls does the same at any time, as one step you can undo

## v0.24.0

Playback speed changes what a step draws, and the phone gets a speed choice of its own.

- **Three speed tiers**: at 0.4 s a step or slower the marker travels with its `+N`; faster,
  `+N` appears when it arrives; below 0.2 s the path flashes and the marker appears at its
  end; Step always shows the full movement
- **Playback speed on the phone**: More → Playback speed offers Slow, Normal, Fast and Very
  fast
- **Fewer moving markers on the phone**: at most 12 a step, and no departure ring; every
  other move keeps its highlighted path and arrival

## v0.23.0

Playback shows what happens inside the nodes: a Pool lights up as a marker arrives, and a
Converter shows that it converts.

- **The Pool lights up on arrival**: when a moving marker reaches a Pool, the inside of the
  Pool briefly glows, under its title and value; the number still changes when the step ends
- **A conversion mark inside the Converter**: while a Converter's markers move, a small
  two-arrow mark shows inside it, at a spot clear of its text, and fades when the step ends
- **Never faded by Focus mode**: both stay at full strength in nodes outside the focus; with
  reduced motion they stay still for the step, and in forced colours the glow is a thin line

## v0.22.0

Playback shows what moved where: the path a Gate took, and every amount beside its moving
marker.

- **The Gate's path lights up**: during a run, each branch a Gate actually sends something
  down is highlighted under its moving marker; a branch that carries nothing keeps its usual
  look
- **`+N` beside every moving marker**: the amount a connection carries in a step rides
  beside its marker as a badge, from `+1`; the connection's own label stays in place and
  fades only while the badge passes over it
- **Focus mode wins on connections**: the markers, badges and highlights on connections
  outside the focus fade with those connections; in a busy step at most 24 markers move, and
  every other connection that moved is highlighted instead

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the full notes of these releases, v0.21.4 (the
canvas controls keep their place while editing is locked), v0.21.3 (the edit
lock is exact, and its button shows the state), v0.21.2 (values
and detail rows sit inside their node), v0.21.1 (Focus
mode dims the connections too), v0.21.0 (compact
nodes, so more of a large graph fits in view), v0.20.0 (flow
colours in the minimap and the timeline), v0.19.0 (flow
colours on nodes and connections), v0.18.2 (the
guided tour says each step once), v0.18.1 (one
keyboard contract for every menu), v0.18.0 (the third-party open-source licenses in the About dialog), v0.17.2 (the
Temporary session button drawn like the menu buttons), v0.17.1 (share
links compressed with the browser's own Compression Streams), v0.17.0
(password-protected share links), v0.16.0 (the storage gate, temporary sessions and the
Storage and privacy area), the v0.15 releases and every earlier one.
