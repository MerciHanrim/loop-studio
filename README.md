# Loop Studio

Loop Studio is a browser-based **visual systems editor and simulator** —
draw a Machinations-style diagram of pools, sources, drains, gates, and
converters, then run a deterministic, seeded simulation to see how the
system behaves over time. Built primarily for **game economies**, the same
step-based model generalises to inventory/supply chains, service queues,
cash flows, and other resource-flow systems; it's an independent, client-only
implementation — nothing is uploaded, the whole app runs in your browser, and
a graph is a plain JSON file you own. Work is kept in your browser profile
only when you say it is your own browser; on a shared computer a temporary
session neither reads nor saves stored work, author information or settings
([docs/storage-sessions.md](docs/storage-sessions.md)).

**Run it now: <https://cozy-loop-studio.pages.dev>** — available in
[18 languages](#languages), with five bundled Templates ranging from a small
production flow to a large game economy and a three-zone probability/pity
comparison.

## Key features

- **Visual diagram editor** — pools, sources, drains, gates, and converters;
  resources move between them on a deterministic, discrete-step simulation;
  select a region of nodes from the rail and move them together, or place nodes
  in a named frame that moves with its contents
- **Seeded RNG + Monte Carlo** — probabilistic gates and flows, and
  many-run outcome distributions with percentile bands
- **A small model language** — `parameter` / `register` nodes with a safe
  arithmetic expression grammar, guided `@`-autocomplete authoring, and a
  name-and-value read-back
- **Executable state connections** — `trigger` (+ delay), `activator`, and
  `label` Pool modifiers, with in-canvas pulse / tint / flash feedback
- **Simulation playback** — resources visibly depart, travel the real edge
  path, and arrive before values update, in dependency order
- **Data import & collaboration** — bring the numbers you already keep in a
  spreadsheet (CSV/TSV paste or upload) in as adjustable Parameters, with a
  manual refresh and a three-way diff — see [`docs/import-guide.md`](docs/import-guide.md);
  plus file-based project revisions & proposals for asynchronous
  collaboration — no accounts, no server
- **Runs anywhere** — an installable offline PWA, a portable single-file
  build, shareable links (optionally protected with a password), and a UI translated into
  [18 languages](#languages)

## Languages

<!-- LOCALES:BEGIN — the codes in this table are checked against the locale
     registry by `src/i18n/readmeLocales.test.ts`. Adding or removing a shipped
     language must update this table in the same change. -->

The UI ships in 18 languages, listed here the way the in-app picker orders
them. Pick one under **Settings → Language**; the first visit follows your
browser's language, and the choice is remembered on that device.

| Code | Language | In its own words |
|---|---|---|
| `ar` | Arabic | العربية |
| `zh-Hans` | Chinese (Simplified) | 简体中文 |
| `zh-Hant` | Chinese (Traditional) | 繁體中文 |
| `nl` | Dutch | Nederlands |
| `en` | English | English |
| `fr` | French | Français |
| `de` | German | Deutsch |
| `it` | Italian | Italiano |
| `ja` | Japanese | 日本語 |
| `ko` | Korean | 한국어 |
| `pt-BR` | Portuguese (Brazil) | Português (Brasil) |
| `pt-PT` | Portuguese (Portugal) | Português (Portugal) |
| `ru` | Russian | Русский |
| `es-419` | Spanish (Latin America) | Español (Latinoamérica) |
| `es-ES` | Spanish (Spain) | Español (España) |
| `th` | Thai | ไทย |
| `tr` | Turkish | Türkçe |
| `vi` | Vietnamese | Tiếng Việt |

<!-- LOCALES:END -->

Regional pairs are separate locales, not one catalog with a flag: a browser
asking for `pt-PT` gets European Portuguese, while `pt`, `pt-BR` and the
African Portuguese tags get Brazilian — and the same split holds for the two
Spanish and the two Chinese catalogs. See
[`docs/localization.md`](docs/localization.md) for the resolution order and
the per-locale notes.

## Representative use cases

The *3-zone gacha banner comparison* Template runs three pity/pickup rule
sets — **General/Free**, **Premium Standard** (hard-pity ceiling), and
**Premium Pickup** (hard-pity + a pickup guarantee) — side by side, 200 pulls
per zone under identical run settings. Once a run completes, its hit and
pickup rates are easy to compare; run Monte Carlo analysis to inspect the
distribution across many runs.

![The gacha Template after a completed 200-pull-per-zone run: five comparison cards reading real hit-rate/pickup-rate percentages, a Timeline with per-zone SSR/pickup curves, and a Register's expression read-back open in the right column](docs/assets/gacha-overview.png)

*Premium Pickup, framed on its own* — the hard-pity counter forces the next
roll's SSR once it hits the ceiling; whether that (or any ordinary) SSR lands
as pickup or standard depends on the `Pickup owed` guarantee flag, which a
miss sets and the next SSR consumes.

## Develop locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev             # http://localhost:5173
npm run build            # -> dist/            static SPA, deploy anywhere
npm run build:portable   # -> dist-portable/   single self-contained index.html (file://)
npm run lint
npm test                 # vitest (engine + store unit tests)
npm run e2e              # Playwright browser end-to-end
```

Requires **Node 22+** (`.nvmrc` pins `22`). React + TypeScript + Vite,
[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) for the canvas, Zustand for state; the
simulation engine is a dependency-free, unit-tested TypeScript module kept
separate from the UI. Deployed on Cloudflare Pages; CI on GitHub Actions.

## Technical reference

Behaviour is frozen in versioned spec documents; a behavioural change means a
new spec id, never an edit to a frozen one.

## Latest — v0.21.1

A fix release: Focus mode dims the connections too.

- **Connections outside the focus set fade** like the nodes there, path and arrowhead,
  whatever their activator says; before, only the nodes were dimmed
- **What stays at full strength is unchanged**: selection, warnings and the moving markers
  of a running simulation; under high contrast a faded connection is a fine dotted line

## v0.21.0

Compact nodes: more of a large graph fits in view.

- **Shorter, a little narrower**: a one-line node is 56 px tall instead of 64, with less
  side padding, so more of a big graph fits at the same zoom
- **Content still decides**: two-line titles, capacity rows, Parameters and Registers keep
  the height they need, and long titles wrap as before
- **Nothing in a file changes**: positions, saved diagrams and simulation results stay the
  same; connections attach a few pixels higher

## v0.20.0

Flow colours beyond the canvas.

- **The minimap and the timeline** show a coloured node in its colour; a coloured Pool or
  Register draws its timeline line in it, and every other series keeps its own
- **Three templates in colour**: Coffee roastery, the gacha banner and early MMO open with
  three colours on their main flows; their results are unchanged
- **Each colour once** in the Inspector: Recent and In this document leave out the colours
  already shown above them
- **On a phone**, the read-only Inspector shows a colour as one line: a dot, its name and hex

## v0.19.0

Flow colours: give nodes and connections a colour so a large graph's flows read apart.

- **The Inspector's Colour section** colours every selected node and connection at once:
  five palette colours, recent ones, the colours already in the diagram, a hex value or any
  colour from the browser's picker; Default removes it
- **Kept everywhere, changing nothing it computes**: saved with the diagram and in links
  and undo, and a colour change never resets the run or a Monte Carlo result
- **Selection stays clear on any colour**: a selected node shows a ring outside its
  outline, a selected connection a highlight beneath it
- **Advice, never a block**: a colour that would be hard to see, or that looks like a
  colour the canvas uses for focus, warnings or a run, is still applied, with a note

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the full notes of these releases, v0.18.2 (the
guided tour says each step once), v0.18.1 (one
keyboard contract for every menu), v0.18.0 (the third-party open-source licenses in the About dialog), v0.17.2 (the
Temporary session button drawn like the menu buttons), v0.17.1 (share
links compressed with the browser's own Compression Streams), v0.17.0
(password-protected share links), v0.16.0 (the storage gate, temporary sessions and the
Storage and privacy area), the v0.15 releases and every earlier one.
